## 🔍 Understanding AI in Cyber Security

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to computer systems that perform tasks requiring human intelligence — such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making.  
In cyber security, AI analyzes massive datasets to recognize patterns, detect anomalies, and respond to potential threats automatically. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, AI can identify **new or unknown attacks** by learning from experience.

## ⚙️ Key Applications

- **Threat Detection:** AI monitors network activity and flags suspicious behavior in real time.  
- **Predictive Analysis:** Learns from past incidents to forecast potential vulnerabilities.  
- **Automated Response:** Instantly isolates infected systems or blocks malicious devices.  
- **Phishing Protection:** Detects fake links, suspicious attachments, and fraudulent emails.  
- **Malware Analysis:** Uses behavior-based detection to identify malicious files.  
- **Identity Management:** Enhances login security using biometrics and anomaly detection.
